Build a full-stack web application for HR resume analysis and candidate ranking.

GOAL:
Create a website where HR users can upload one or multiple CVs (PDF/DOCX or links), optionally provide GitHub or code repository links, and receive AI-driven analysis, charts, rankings, and insights.

CORE FEATURES:

1) CV INPUT
- Upload:
  - Single CV
  - Multiple CVs
  - Or provide URLs to CV files (public links or folders)
- Automatically fetch and process CVs from provided sources.

2) CV PARSING & ANALYSIS (Python AI backend)
- Extract:
  - Skills
  - Programming languages
  - Work experience
  - Education
  - Projects
- Detect most-used programming languages.
- If GitHub or code repository links are provided:
  - Fetch public repositories
  - Analyze languages used
  - Commit frequency and consistency
  - Project structure and tooling
  - Generate a "vibe coding score" based on activity, consistency, and modern practices.

3) AI INSIGHTS & VERIFICATION
- Generate charts:
  - Skill distribution
  - Language usage
  - Experience timeline
- Detect potential inconsistencies:
  - Compare CV claims vs GitHub or code evidence
  - Flag possible exaggerations or gaps
  - Never claim certainty — only "potential inconsistencies" with confidence scores.

4) CANDIDATE SCORING (IMPORTANT)
Support TWO MODES:

MODE A: MANUAL EQUATION
- HR can define a custom scoring equation:
  - Skills weight
  - Experience weight
  - GitHub / code weight
  - Education weight
- Each candidate receives a final numeric score.
- Rank candidates by score.

MODE B: AI-GENERATED METRIC
- If no equation is provided:
  - The AI automatically creates a scoring metric
  - Adapts to job description and seniority
- The AI must explain:
  - Factors used
  - Why candidates ranked higher or lower

5) MULTI-CV COMPARISON
- Rank candidates from best to worst.
- Provide:
  - AI-generated summary per candidate
  - Strengths and weaknesses
  - Reason for ranking position.

6) AUTOMATION
- Allow linking CV sources (folders or URLs)
- Periodically re-analyze candidates automatically.

7) PRICING & SUBSCRIPTIONS
Implement a simple subscription system:

PLANS:
- Free:
  - Limited number of CV analyses per month
  - No GitHub deep analysis
  - Basic charts only

- Pro:
  - Higher CV limit
  - GitHub / code analysis enabled
  - Vibe coding score
  - Multi-CV comparison
  - Custom scoring equations

- Enterprise:
  - Unlimited CVs
  - Automated CV source syncing
  - Advanced AI metrics
  - Priority processing
  - Exportable reports (PDF)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Track usage per user (CV count, analysis runs)
- Block or limit features when plan limits are reached
- Show upgrade prompts in UI
- Pricing values can be placeholders (configurable later)

8) AUTHENTICATION
- User accounts with login/signup
- Each user belongs to a subscription plan
- Persist user data and analysis history

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS:
- Frontend: modern but simple UI
- Backend: Python
- All AI logic must be in Python
- Use libraries for:
  - PDF/DOCX parsing
  - GitHub API access
  - Data analysis
  - Chart generation
- Database: SQLite (upgradeable later)

AI BEHAVIOR RULES:
- Explainable decisions
- No absolute claims about lying
- Show confidence scores
- Optimize UX for non-technical HR users

OUTPUT:
- Working web app
- Upload interface
- Analysis dashboard
- Candidate ranking page
- Pricing page
- Subscription logic enforced

IMPORTANT:
- Clean, maintainable project structure
- Commented Python code
- Design for future extensibility
